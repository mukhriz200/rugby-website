    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>My name is Muhammad Mukhriz. I started playing rugby at the age of 12, first representing my primary school as a backline player in the centre position.During my secondary school years, I transitioned to playing in the forward pack as a first prop.

I then continued my rugby journey at UiTM Johor, where I played in the second prop and second row positions.To me, rugby is more than just a game, it's something that's become a part of who I am.</p>

    <h2>My Journey</h2>
    <p>I started playing rugby in school, and over time, it became more than just a sports, it became my identity. I went from being just another player to someone who inspired others on the field.
After several matches at the university level, I suffered a Stage 2 ACL tear in my left knee. Despite the setback, I never gave up on rugby. Although I'm no longer actively playing, I've continued my journey in the sport by coaching the rugby squad at my former school, Malacca High School.

    <h2>Values</h2>
    <p>Rugby is more than a sport for me, it is a way to become a real man by teaching responsibility, which is essential in life. The game builds resilience, pushing you to never give up despite challenges. It also demands discipline, requiring focus and dedication both on and off the field. Teamwork is at its core, reminding us that success is achieved together. Ultimately, rugby is not just about winning, but about personal growth, perseverance, and strong values.
